### Team of (Redacted*)

Our security research partner contributes a team of leading hardware security professionals, who are experienced in the state of the art of hardware design and protection. They operate one of the most sophisticated hardware labs, a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to the comprehensive analysis and enhancement of hardware security. Equipped with advanced tools and technologies, the lab specializes in evaluating and fortifying integrated circuits, microchips, and multi-chip modules against a wide array of physical and logical attack vectors.​

#### Key Areas of Expertise:

* Side-Channel Analysis: The lab conducts in-depth examinations of cryptographic implementations to detect vulnerabilities that may leak sensitive information through indirect channels such as power consumption or electromagnetic emissions. Utilizing high-precision measurement equipment, researchers perform sophisticated attacks—including Differential Power Analysis (DPA) and Electromagnetic Analysis (EMA)—to assess and improve the resilience of hardware against such threats. ​

* Fault Injection Attacks: Researchers employ techniques to deliberately induce faults in hardware systems to study their effects on security. The lab is equipped with multiple laser stations capable of frontside and backside fault injection, allowing for precise manipulation of electronic circuits. These methods are instrumental in evaluating a device's robustness against attacks that exploit induced errors to extract secret information or alter execution flows. ​

* Hardware Penetration Testing: The lab offers offensive security analyses of embedded systems, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities arising from design flaws or insecure configurations. This includes evaluating firmware and intellectual property protection features in microcontrollers, as well as assessing the security of various interfaces and communication protocols. ​

* Tamper Protection and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs): To safeguard against physical tampering, the lab develops and evaluates tamper protection methods, including the use of PUFs. These unique hardware fingerprints assess the physical integrity of devices, ensuring that any unauthorized alterations are detectable. ​

* Machine Learning Applications in Security: The integration of machine learning techniques enhances the analysis of complex data derived from side-channel measurements and sensor networks. By applying advanced algorithms, the lab improves the detection of subtle vulnerabilities and refines countermeasure strategies. ​

In recognition of its rigorous standards and capabilities, the Hardware Security Lab achieved certification to Evaluation Assurance Level 7 (EAL 7) under the Common Criteria in 2024. This distinction underscores the lab's commitment to providing top-tier security evaluations for both hardware and software systems. ​
