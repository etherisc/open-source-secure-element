# Building the world's first <br />*Open Source Secure Element* 

The Open Source Secure Element (OSSE) project aims to develop the first fully open-source secure element based on the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) framework, designed to address critical security and transparency needs in the crypto ecosystem. One of the first and most important applications would be an insurable crypto hardware wallet.

## Project Overview

This project will deliver an open source secure element and hardware wallet that provides:

- Robust support for Ethereum standards, such as EIP-712 for transaction signing
- Blockchain-based supply chain documentation to ensure trust and verifiability
- Integration with tailored insurance solutions for non-custodial wallets
- An affordable and transparent alternative to proprietary wallets

The secure element at the core of the project will also provide a key component for numerous cryptographic applications, including Complete Knowledge Proofs and validator hardware.

## Key Features

- **Open Source Design**: Fully transparent hardware and software components
- **Secure Element**: Based on the OpenTitan framework for silicon root-of-trust
- **Insurability**: First non-custodial wallet with insurance capabilities
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Blockchain-based documentation of hardware components
- **Enhanced Security**: Support for EIP-712 and elimination of blind signing

## Project Status

The project is currently in its initial development phase, with significant groundwork laid to establish the technical foundation. Development boards for the OpenTitan project are available, including the ChipWhisperer CW340 FPGA board, which will serve as the basis for the hardware wallet's prototype.

Etherisc has signed an LoI with a leading german security research facility, which will be revealed when the project is funded.
