# Implementation Details

This page outlines the specific implementation details for the Open Source Secure Element (OSSE) project, focusing on the technical aspects of the hardware wallet development.

## Hardware Implementation

### Secure Element Design

The secure element will be implemented using the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) framework, which provides:

- A fully open-source design for secure microcontrollers
- Cryptographic acceleration for common algorithms
- Secure boot capabilities
- Memory protection and isolation features
- Tamper resistance mechanisms

The initial implementation will use the ChipWhisperer CW340 FPGA board to prototype the secure element functionality before moving to a custom hardware design.

### Physical Components

The hardware wallet will include:

- **Main Processor**: RISC-V based processor (Ibex core from [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/))
- **Secure Storage**: For encrypted key storage
- **Display**: OLED or LCD display for showing transaction details
- **Input Buttons**: For user interaction and transaction approval
- **USB Interface**: For connectivity with host devices
- **Power Management**: For efficient battery usage and power protection

## Software Implementation

### Firmware Architecture

The firmware will be structured in layers:

1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**: Interfaces directly with the hardware
2. **Cryptographic Services**: Implements cryptographic operations
3. **Wallet Core**: Manages keys and transactions
4. **User Interface**: Handles display and user input
5. **Communication Protocol**: Manages external communications

### Key Management

The wallet will implement secure key management:

- **Key Generation**: Using hardware random number generation
- **Key Derivation**: Following BIP-32/BIP-39/BIP-44 standards
- **Key Storage**: Encrypted storage with hardware protection
- **Key Usage**: Secure signing operations without exposing private keys

### Transaction Signing

The wallet will support:

- **EIP-712 Structured Data Signing**: For clear transaction representation
- **Transaction Parsing**: To display human-readable transaction details
- **Approval Mechanism**: Requiring explicit user confirmation
- **Multiple Signature Schemes**: Supporting various cryptographic algorithms

## Security Implementation

### Hardware Security Measures

- **Side-Channel Attack Protection**: Implementing countermeasures against power analysis and electromagnetic analysis
- **Physical Tamper Resistance**: Designing the hardware to resist physical tampering
- **Secure Element Isolation**: Ensuring the secure element is isolated from other components

### Software Security Measures

- **Secure Boot Chain**: Verifying firmware integrity at startup
- **Memory Protection**: Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive memory regions
- **Input Validation**: Thoroughly validating all inputs to prevent attacks
- **Secure Update Mechanism**: Allowing secure firmware updates while preventing downgrade attacks

## Supply Chain Documentation

The project will implement a blockchain-based supply chain documentation system:

- **Component Tracking**: Recording the origin and manufacturing details of critical components
- **Assembly Verification**: Documenting the assembly process
- **Tamper Evidence**: Providing evidence of any tampering attempts
- **Ownership Transfer**: Tracking the chain of custody from manufacturing to end-user

## Insurability Features

To enable insurance for the non-custodial wallet, the implementation will include:

- **Address Whitelisting/Blacklisting**: Allowing users to restrict transactions to approved addresses
- **Transaction Limits**: Setting limits on transaction amounts
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Requiring multiple approvals for high-value transactions
- **Social Recovery**: Implementing secure recovery mechanisms for lost devices
- **Audit Logging**: Maintaining secure logs of wallet activities for insurance claims

These implementation details will evolve as the project progresses, with updates and refinements based on testing, security audits, and community feedback.
