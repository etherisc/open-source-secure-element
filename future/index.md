# Future Plans

This section outlines the risks, challenges, and future plans for the Open Source Secure Element (OSSE) project beyond the initial grant-funded development phase. Understanding both the potential obstacles and the long-term vision is essential for the project's success and sustainability.

## Overview

The OSSE project is designed with a clear vision that extends beyond the initial 6-month feasibility study and prototype development phase. While the grant-funded portion focuses on establishing the technical foundation and creating a working prototype, the long-term plan involves scaling the project for widespread adoption and ensuring its sustainability.

## Key Areas

### Risk Management

The project team has identified several critical risks and challenges that could impact the project's implementation and success. These include technical challenges, hardware component availability, supply chain documentation complexity, security risks, community adoption issues, market and insurance challenges, and financial constraints.

Detailed information about these risks and the corresponding mitigation strategies can be found on the [Risks & Challenges](./risks/) page.

### Post-Grant Plans

Upon completing the grant-funded development phases, the focus will shift to scaling the project for widespread adoption and ensuring its sustainability. This includes:

1. **Serial Production**: Transitioning from prototype to large-scale production
2. **Ecosystem Integration**: Collaborating with Ethereum projects and platforms
3. **Insurance Solutions**: Expanding insurability features and insurance products
4. **Open-Source Development**: Maintaining and improving the project as an open-source initiative
5. **New Applications**: Exploring new use cases and markets

## Commitment to Open Source

Throughout all future phases, the project will maintain its commitment to open-source principles, ensuring that all developments remain transparent, accessible, and beneficial to the broader community. This commitment aligns with the project's goal of creating a public good that addresses critical gaps in the blockchain ecosystem.
