# Risks & Challenges

While the Open Source Secure Element (OSSE) project has a well-defined roadmap and leverages proven technologies like the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) framework, several risks and challenges could arise during implementation and in achieving the desired impacts. Below are the critical risks and mitigation strategies:

## 1. Technical Challenges

**Risk**: The [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) framework, while robust, may present unforeseen technical difficulties in adapting its silicon root of trust (RoT) features to the unique requirements of a hardware wallet. Porting wallet firmware to the RISC-V architecture and integrating advanced features like EIP-712 may require additional time and resources.

**Mitigation**: 
- Collaborate closely with (Redacted*), leveraging their expertise in cryptographic hardware design to address technical challenges.
- Adopt an iterative development approach to identify and resolve issues early in the development cycle.

## 2. Hardware Component Availability

**Risk**: Delays in the availability of [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/)-based chipsets or other critical hardware components could impact project timelines.

**Mitigation**: 
- Use the CW340 Luna FPGA board as an interim platform to prototype key functionalities while waiting for production-grade chipsets.
- Explore alternative components to maintain progress if significant delays occur.

## 3. Supply Chain Documentation Complexity

**Risk**: Implementing a blockchain-based system for supply chain transparency could prove challenging, particularly in integrating data from multiple manufacturers and verifying its accuracy.

**Mitigation**: 
- Partner with experienced supply chain and blockchain professionals to design a scalable and reliable system.
- Conduct pilot tests with selected components to refine the process before full-scale implementation.

## 4. Security Risks

**Risk**: Hardware and firmware may be exposed to novel attack vectors during or after development, compromising the wallet's security.

**Mitigation**: 
- Conduct thorough security testing and independent audits of both hardware and software.
- Build defenses against known attack vectors, such as side-channel attacks, and continuously monitor for emerging threats.

## 5. Community Adoption and Collaboration

**Risk**: Limited community engagement or reluctance from related projects (e.g., Firefly wallet) to collaborate could hinder ecosystem integration and reduce impact.

**Mitigation**: 
- Actively engage with the Ethereum developer community and other open-source projects, sharing progress and soliciting feedback throughout development.
- Offer incentives, such as early access to tools and documentation, to encourage collaboration.

## 6. Market and Insurance Challenges

**Risk**: Insuring non-custodial wallets is a relatively new concept, and unexpected regulatory or operational hurdles could arise. The market demand for the wallet may not materialize as anticipated, affecting adoption rates.

**Mitigation**: 
- Work closely with ver.de AG to design an insurance model that complies with regulations and meets user needs.
- Conduct user research to ensure the wallet's design and features align with market demand, adjusting the project scope if necessary.

## 7. Financial and Resource Constraints

**Risk**: Unforeseen expenses or delays could exceed the allocated budget or strain available resources.

**Mitigation**: 
- Implement rigorous project management and cost control measures.
- Explore additional funding sources or partnerships if needed to maintain momentum.

## Conclusion

While these risks are significant, they are manageable through proactive planning, strong partnerships, and iterative development. By addressing these challenges effectively, the project will achieve its goal of delivering a secure, insurable, and transparent hardware wallet to the Ethereum ecosystem.
