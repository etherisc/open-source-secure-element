## Project Duration

- **Total Duration**: 6 months
- **Start Date**: Upon funding approval
- **End Date**: 6 months after project initiation

## Key Milestones

1. **Month 1**: Completion of the feasibility study
   - Analysis of the OpenTitan framework
   - Design of the blockchain-based supply chain documentation system
   - Evaluation of security features and their integration with Ethereum standards

2. **Month 2-3**: Development environment setup
   - Configuration of the CW340 Luna FPGA board
   - Implementation of basic secure element functionality
   - Setup of development and testing environments

3. **Month 4-5**: Prototype development
   - Implementation of secure key generation
   - Development of transaction signing capabilities
   - Integration of encrypted key storage

4. **Month 6**: Testing and documentation
   - Security testing and validation
