# Project Overview

## Building the world's first *Open Source Secure Element*

This project aims to develop the first fully open-source hardware wallet, built around a secure element based on the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) framework, designed to address critical security and transparency needs in the crypto ecosystem.

The wallet will provide robust support for Ethereum standards, such as EIP-712 for transaction signing, and will integrate blockchain-based supply chain documentation to ensure trust and verifiability. By combining open-source software and hardware with tailored insurance solutions, this project will deliver the first insurable, non-custodial crypto wallet.

It will be an affordable and transparent alternative to proprietary wallets, fostering broader adoption of secure decentralized finance tools. The secure element, which is at the core of the project, will also provide a key component for numerous cryptographic applications, e.g. Complete Knowledge Proofs and validator hardware.

## Project Repository

The project is being developed openly on GitHub: [https://github.com/etherisc/open-source-secure-element](https://github.com/etherisc/open-source-secure-element)

## Project Category

Security

## Current Status

The project is currently in its initial development phase. While a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) has not yet been created, significant groundwork has been laid to establish the technical foundation.

Development boards for the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) project are available, including the ChipWhisperer CW340 FPGA board, which will serve as the basis for the hardware wallet's prototype.

(Redacted*) and Etherisc have signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to collaborate on the design and implementation of the secure hardware wallet.

## Research and Planning

Research and planning efforts have focused on leveraging the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) framework, which provides a transparent, open-source reference design for silicon root-of-trust (RoT) chips.

The project roadmap includes using the CW340 development board to prototype the wallet's core functionality, such as secure key generation, transaction signing, and encrypted key storage.

The current stage involves feasibility studies and architecture planning, with a clear pathway toward creating a fully functioning prototype ready for serial production.
