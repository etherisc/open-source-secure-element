# Public Good Contributions

The Open Source Secure Element (OSSE) project embodies the ethos of public goods by contributing valuable open-source resources, fostering community engagement, and addressing critical gaps in the blockchain ecosystem that are often overlooked by market-driven initiatives. Below are the key ways this project will result in a public good:

## 1. Open-Source Code and Hardware Design

The project will release all hardware and software components as open source, including:

- Wallet firmware
- Secure element design
- Blockchain-based supply chain documentation tools

This transparency ensures that anyone can inspect, audit, or improve the wallet's functionality, reducing reliance on proprietary solutions and enhancing trust within the ecosystem. Developers can reuse or adapt the project's code and designs for other applications, fostering innovation across the blockchain space.

## 2. Shared Infrastructure

By leveraging and extending the [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) framework, the project will contribute to the development of secure, open-source microcontroller designs. These improvements can be used in other security-critical applications, such as:

- Validators
- IoT devices
- Zero-knowledge proof systems

The blockchain-based supply chain documentation system can serve as a reusable infrastructure for ensuring transparency and trust in other hardware or production processes.

## 3. Openly Shared Research and Documentation

The project will publish and freely share:

- Feasibility studies
- Hardware design specifications
- Development processes
- Comprehensive documentation

These resources will empower developers, researchers, and educators to learn from and build upon the project. The project's findings on integrating insurability mechanisms for non-custodial wallets will contribute to broader discussions on security and insurance in the crypto space.

## 4. Community Building and Collaboration

The project will actively engage with:

- The Ethereum developer community
- Related open-source initiatives (such as the Firefly wallet)
- Educational institutions and research organizations

By fostering collaboration and shared learning, the project will strengthen the open-source ecosystem and encourage the adoption of best practices for wallet security and usability. Educational resources, such as tutorials and workshops, will help onboard developers and users, promoting greater adoption of secure non-custodial wallet solutions.

## 5. Addressing Market Gaps

The project addresses critical issues that are under-provided by market-driven solutions, which often prioritize profit over user empowerment:

- **Transparency**: Open-source design versus proprietary black boxes
- **Insurability**: Enabling insurance for non-custodial wallets
- **Accessibility**: Creating affordable hardware security solutions
- **User Autonomy**: Providing security without sacrificing control

By providing a secure, affordable, and transparent hardware wallet, the project empowers individuals to manage their crypto assets confidently without relying on centralized custodians or opaque technologies.

## Long-Term Impact

The open-source nature of this project ensures that its benefits extend beyond its immediate goals. By contributing to the collective knowledge and tools of the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader blockchain community, the project lays the foundation for a more secure, transparent, and inclusive future for decentralized finance.

All deliverables will be published under a permissive open source license, ensuring maximum accessibility and reusability for the community.
